Hello, and welcome to my webpage!

My name is Mike Ion, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan and I am currently working on a dissertation in the field of mathematics education under the advisement of [Dr. Patricio Herbst](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/patricio-g-herbst).

## Research Interests
I am interested in developing as a methodologist who is particularly interested in the study of mathematics instruction. Methodologically, theres a wide array of text data available to mathematics education researchers, and I am interested in the implementation of techniques that can help researchers understand mathematics instruction by looking at these data. Although not limited to, this includes the analysis of: corpora of mathematics texts, transcripts of teacher talk, responses to open-response questions asked to teachers going through a teaching simulation, and chat records in an online chat room from students asking for help on their math questions. This latter form of text data serves as the corpus for my dissertation. My dissertation study involves understanding students' conceptions of the derivative in an online Mathematics Discord community. This community is publicly available for anyone to join, is incredibly active (~30,000 members), and has had more than 13 million messages posted since 2015. My hopes are to make use of my expertise in machine learning to: parse the chat logs into separate conversations where the smaller interactions around questions took place, and build classifiers that can code these conversations into the various student conceptions of the derivative.

## After the Ph.D.
I am interested in careers in either academia or in the industry! I have been finding my teaching, research, and coding experiences to all be valuable! :)
