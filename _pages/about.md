I am interested in understanding mathematics teachers' knowledge through their use of language as they reason through various decision points within instructional situations. Methodologically, this involves using machine learning/natural language processing to train models to analyze their responses. I aspire to specialize as a methodologist working on interdisciplinary projects.
